# Follow-up - 17 August 2021

Hey, I really enjoyed today's class, I hope you did, too.

I write a follow-up whenever I said stuff, or put stuff on the
board that emerged during a session. This is uploaded to GitHub
where you can comment, ask further, remind me of something I
promised and forgot, or raise any other issue. This may show up in
the weekly tests (and then also in the final exam, which is
sourced from the tests).

Don't worry about the amount (or type) of information contained
herein: I write these things up partly for myself, and partly for
those interested, but I don't expect you to learn or know them at
any point during this class. And I'll cease writing them up when I
run out of time, which I often do towards the end of term.

As part of your term project, you will come across a lot of new
technical terms. To sort through them, you'll need to create a
glossary. These follow-ups are my glossary for the course.

## Agile methods

"Kanban" is the Japanese word for "sign". It stands for a simple
"agile" method (in the technical sense) of organizing tasks on a
board using post-its or other means. An app that implements the
Kanban principle for private users is Trello. Kanban boards -
often analog rather than digital - are common in production
(e.g. to keep an overview of warehouse stock). In the course, you
will use the agile method "Scrum" for your project work. Agile
methods are widely used in industry and software engineering.


## LaTeX and TeX

Gold standard of Open Source text formatting and font systems
(there is another one just for fonts called Metafont). Created by
Donald Knuth from Stanford U. who is also the author of "The Art
of Computer Programming" ([TAOCP](https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/taocp.html)). As soon as my boat has arrived
from Europe, you should take a look at these books, which are
mainly about algorithms and fairly mathematical. For the book,
Knuth created an artificial assembly language, MIX, which runs on
a hypothetical MIX computer. A little like like pseudocode.


## Git and Linux

The Linux kernel and the version control program were both
created by Finnish-American computer programmer Linus
Torvalds. The connection: Linux is one of the largest (if not the
largest) open source project. I'll be teaching operating systems
in Spring 2022, and Linux will figure prominently in that
course. Git is the software used for the GitHub developers'
platform (and many other similar platforms, like GitLab,
BitBucket, SourceForge etc.)


## Emacs editor

You're going to hear, and see, enough of this "extensible text
editor" written in Lisp (one of the oldest functional programming
languages). Emacs is a great Integrated Development Environment
(IDE), and much more than that. I use it as an IDE for R in
connection with the Emacs Speaks Statistics (`ESS`) package, but
I also use the Org-mode package for all my note taking and task
management, and as an alternative to the interactive Jupyter
notebook. Notebooks are an example of Literate Programming,
another invention of Donald Knuth's.

I usually pepper the follow-ups with links and articles, but I'm
tired, and I still have another syllabus to write and a lecture
to prepare so I'll leave this job to you!

In our second session later this week, I'll finish the course
overview and I'll introduce you to the GitHub and DataCamp
platforms. That'll do for the start!
