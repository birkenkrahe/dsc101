<p>
Pythagoras of Samos was a Greek philosopher who lived around 500
BC. He and his followers conceived of nature as a structured system
of numbers. That was an exciting time in the history of science -
before anyone called it science! With numbers out in the open as
important entities, it was now possible to make all kinds of
exciting discoveries: like harmony in music, or the so-called
Pythagorean theorem (\(a^2+b^2=c^2\)) and many other <a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Pythag/pythag.html">facts about
right-angled triangles</a>
</p>

<p>
So why are you like Pythagoras? Simply because data science isn't
all that old - it became popular less than 10 years ago. Though it
is not a foundation science (like math or physics) but an
interdisciplinary field, this is an exciting moment in history to
learn about it: you can practically not help yourself making
interesting discoveries!  Something like this doesn't come along all
the time (actually, in my life time, there's only one other event
like it, the development of the World-Wide Web).

<h2 id="orgbd3d066">What will you learn?</h2>
<ul>
<li>How and why data science is so popular</li>

<li>What skills you need to do data science</li>

<li>Which problems data science can solve</li>

<li>What data scientists do all the time</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
In this lesson, I am giving an oveRview<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup> of several aspects of
data science. Though young, it is a field both ill-defined and (or
perhaps because of it) vast and hard to pin down. This outline will
be applied rather than scholarly, focusing on applications and
practice rather than concepts or theory.
</p>

<p>
In its name, "data science" carries both aspects of science and
craft: the 'science' part is responsible for the modus operandi,
which is informed by statistics and math, systematic and logically
rigorous. The 'data' part relates mostly to craft: the ability to
extract insights from data using computing tools. Most data
scientists are more occupied by and with the craft part than with
the science part (cp. <a href="#/slide-org94fa54a">Kozyrkov 2018</a>).
</p>

<p>
Hence, data science so far is a typical support science. It supports
other, more established disciplines in the natural and in the social
sciences. Prominent examples are: economics, genomics, and
epidemiology.
</p>

<p>
The need to use the data "to tell a story" sets data science apart
from both traditional data craft and science. It is the reason why
visualization techniques and theory ("grammar of graphics",
cp. <a href="#/slide-org23b1bf5">Sarkar 2018</a>) play such an important role.
</p>

<p>
I would argue that data science is most successful when supporting
fields that themselves are interdisciplinary and therefore need a
higher degree of communication across different cultures of science
and practice. This is the quasi-definition that I came up with while
preparing these notes:
</p>

<p>
[RAW] <b>DATA</b> + [CODE] + <b>SCIENCE</b> [METHODS] = <b>VALUE</b>
</p>

<p>
Why? Because data always come in "raw" form and have to be wrestled
with. To do this, you need to be able to code (a little anyway). But
in order to achieve the main goal, namely add value,
process-oriented science has to come in, most importantly through
systematic methods and the accompanying processes, to validate
insights and help communicate results. Well, so far, so good.
</p>

<p>
In the following lecture, I will focus on four aspects of data
science: the popularity it currently enjoys (and has enjoyed for the
past 10 years), the skills required to "do data science", and the
processes or activities involved in doing it. We will look at each
of these with some examples.
</p>

<p>
At the end of each chapter, you'll find a quick challenge ("youR
tuRn"<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>) - this is usually just a question related to the
text. Sample answers and hints to challenges are gathered <a href="#/slide-org56e6919">at the end
of the document.</a>

Example: social networking analysis - Predicting Tie Strength
(2009). Paper: <a href="https://1drv.ms/b/s!AhEvK3qWokrvqz6uRFcluk1LEOW5">https://1drv.ms/b/s!AhEvK3qWokrvqz6uRFcluk1LEOW5</a>
</p>

<p>
This paper uses a model to distinguish between weak and strong
ties (with over 85% accuracy) based on a parametrization (=
features to establish splitting the data) and a linear model (=
assumption that the predictive variables are linearly
correlated). Data science is used to address questions hidden in
the data, such as how users relate to one another in social
media, how they behave, perhaps even why they do what they do (=
statistical inference).

In the graph (figure <a href="#/slide-org3ea4566">4</a>) from trends.google.com, "numbers
represent search interest relative to the highest point on the
chart for the given region [worldwide] and time [since logging
trends in 2004]." The trend increased is noticeable. It peaked in
September 2020 (<a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=data%20science,software%20engineering,business%20intelligence,big%20data">Source</a>).

Notice that this list amounts to a visualization, too, because it
suggests an ordering, which is supported by the language: "big
data" sounds like it should be at the top. In fact, "data science"
takes the top spot, and both BI and Software Engineering were a lot
more popular in the past.

Between two of these areas each are application areas:

<ol>
<li>Domain knowledge and statistics support decision science. See

<li>Data analytics are the result of applying database programming
(e.g. with SQL) to domain knowledge problems(this is also
sometimes called 'business intelligence' or BI).</li>

<li>Programming, maths and statistics give rise to various machine
learning (ML) techniques concerned in particular with prediction
and pattern recognition.</li>

Tip: when you come across products you don't know, make it a habit
to look them up - knowing the names and what they stand for will
help you anchor yourself in anything you read, and the most
important products, which are most talked about, are often talked
about for a reason - e.g. because they represent an innovation
and/or an advantage. By knowing the products, you can also learn
something about the innovation. This dependency on products also
shows that both computer and data science are crafts.

"Frankenstein's monster" (based on the novel by "Frankenstein, or
The Modern Prometheus", by Mary Shelley, 1818) is used in
figure <a href="#/slide-org187bf97">7</a> as a metaphor for a working data scientist. it
is a rich metaphor with many connotations.
</p>

<ul>
<li>"Eyes": experience with detecting data patterns. to do this
actually with your eyes is unlikely - you need some tools for
that, but you also need experience to know which tools will
work. example: <code>head(dataset)</code> only prints the first 6 rows of a
dataset giving you an idea of the type of data in the dataset.</li>
<li>"Heart": passion for and creativity with data. "passion" is
perhaps more relevant for the data's origin and for what you can
do with well interpreted data - namely change the world! example:
hans rosling's gapminder animations (and his passionate
storytelling, demonstrated e.g. in Hans Rosling's TED videos.</li>
<li>"Hands": domain knowledge gained by working in an industry for
years, supported by activity in communities like <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3564164/kaggle-where-data-scientists-learn-and-compete.html">kaggle</a> (owned by
google since 2017), which hosts datasets, notebooks and ml
competitions.</li>
<li>"Brain": analytical mindset and knowledge of analysis tools
(none of the tools mentioned here, hadoop, spark, <a href="https://hive.apache.org/">hive</a> - a data
warehouse - or <a href="https://www.sas.com/">sas</a> - another statistical analysis workbench - are
necessary - they are merely nice to know). how do you know that
you have this kind of brain? e.g. if you enjoy getting
quantitative (number-based) answers and if you like visualizations
of complex or complicated data (like the gapminder data). also, if
you like programming or maths, you've likely got such a brain.</li>
<li>"Mouth": communication with colleagues - but not only. in
fact, especially being able to communicate with people who are not
your colleagues (so they are perhaps very different from you) is
key. this is another way of saying that you need to be able to
"tell a story" after data analysis (e.g. <a href="#/slide-org09f0467">Prevos 2020</a>).</li>
<li>"Feet": data science is a very fast-moving technology field,
especially its "machine learning" offshoot (which is not part of
this course) - cp. <a href="#/slide-org2283225">Kozyrkov 2019</a>. you need to keep on top of the available
information. at the same time, there is too much to take in and
digest - this means that it is very important to have a sound
understanding of the foundations of data science.</li>

<p>
The value of statistics like shown in figure <a href="#/slide-org2f2e706">9</a> depends on the
exact definitions of the job, on the ability of business to recruit
exactly for what they want etc. I have personally not spoken to any
recruiter about this - I only read career-related blogs and looked
at statistics like these (published by <a href="https://ischoolonline.berkeley.edu/data-science/">Berkeley School of
Information 2020</a>, a site that is interested in attracting data
science students, therefore highly biased). However, as a rule, you
can never go wrong with growing your skill stack, especially with
regard to STEM skills, and within these especially with regard to
your ability to analyse data quantitatively - which is what data
science boils down to. For more details on "data science careers",
see <a href="#/slide-orgc82813a">Robinson/Nolis (2020)</a>.
</p>

<p>
Mathematics, especially statistics, programming and databases are
the skill-based disciplines that you need to master. Having said
that: "mastering" could easily take not one, but several life times,
and you need to begin somewhere. If you do this in earnest, you'll
soon find that you start learning faster and faster the more
connections with what you already know you can make.] Here is a
(free) book called, incidentally, "<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf">Foundations of Data Science</a>"
(<a href="#/slide-org55820a3">Blum et al 2015, 466 p.</a>). It includes some geometry, graph theory,
linear algebra, markov chains, and a variety of algorithms for
"massive data problems" like streaming, sketching and sampling

Introductory DataCamp courses on data science "for everyone" (that
is, without being tied to one of the three dominant languages -
Python, R, or SQL), contain a job profile section to help users
find their professional data science niche.
</p>

<p>
The figure <a href="#/slide-org6a348c9">10</a> shows four such profiles from a 2020
course. What is notably missing here is the maths and/or CS or
software engineering knowledge required or desirable to fill these
roles. But there are also people who say that you best come to a
firm as a general-purpose computer scientist and then learn any of
these on the job depending on the needs and the available
experience.

<p>
The cartoon in figure <a href="#/slide-orgf77cc68">11</a> is by Google's head of "decision
intelligence", <a href="#/slide-org2283225">Cassie Kozyrkov (2018)</a>. She has a specific,
business- and decision-oriented idea of the purpose of data
science, which I share: data science is there to help you make
decisions. The option tree shown distinguishes three sub-fields of
data science: data analytics, statistics and machine learning. It
asks if you're "making decisions" at the start (many, few, hardly
any), it quickly focuses on the type of data (few vs big) and the
'uncertainty' and 'importance' of the decisions. This is still a
data-centric, not a decision-centric taxonomy. A focus on the
latter would allow for many more options (e.g. strategic
vs. tactical, organizational vs. managerial, routine
vs. exceptional decisions etc.) Hence, for decision science, this
kind of breakdown is not very useful.
</p>

<p>
The dominance of "big data" has also been doubted, especially when
it comes to making (business) decisions. "Small [not big] data"
(<a href="#/slide-org962a85b">Saklani, 2017</a>) and "thick [qualitative, descriptive] data" may be
just as good depending on what you want to know. The article by
<a href="#/slide-org478ef25">Chiu (2020)</a> is a bit of a history hack (in the scholarly sense) but
it raises some good points.
</p>

<p>
Brandon Rohrer, [then] a data scientist at Microsoft, has addressed
this question in a 3-part series of short articles (<a href="#/slide-org72a643a">Rohrer, 2015a,
2015b, 2015c</a>). His examples are a more specific, especially because
he also says which family of algorithms match which type of
data-related question. It is too early for us to discuss his
taxonomy but at the end of the course, you should have a better
idea about what you can do with data science tools.
</p>

<p>
<b>&#x2026;youR tuRn:</b> Think about any decision you make - what are the
steps you go through? Do they amount to a "data science adventure"
as shown in the figure <a href="#/slide-orgf77cc68">11</a> - why (or why not)? <a href="#/slide-org8551c03">(Hint)</a>

<p>
All system components continuously write data protocols in the form
of simple event logs, which you can view easily on Linux systems
(<a href="https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/viewing-and-monitoring-log-files#1-overview">e.g. on Ubuntu</a>). Check available system logs with <code>ls -la
   /var/log/</code>. Figure <a href="#/slide-org2e0a571">14</a> shows a sample section from my
computer's system log in <code>/var/log/syslog</code>.

<p>
This excerpt shows how and when the computer clock was set remotely,
and the starting of various servers and one socket where my mobile
phone ("Xperia L2") was connected.
</p>

<p>
The language we're about to use in this course (and in the follow
up course on machine learning), R, is well suited for rapid
interactive exploration of datasets such as this one. The two
immediately relevant problem areas are "text mining" (notice that
all system files are human-readable to aid debugging), and "time
series analysis" (event logs are time series).
</p>

<p>
Text mining is considered a part of "Natural Language Processing",
and Time Series Analysis is also really important in finance,
e.g. when analysing portfolio performance.
</p>

<p>
A separate technique (not immediately part of an R programming
course) is "process mining".

Figure <a href="#/slide-orgb82a0c3">16</a> shows a process that begins with raw data. Such data are
usually not formatted as "tidy" data, i.e. "each row represents one
observation and columns represent the different variables available
for each of these observations" (<a href="#/slide-org8f15807">Irizarry 2020</a>). This is also the
tabular format, which is usual for storing data in relational
databases for analysis with SQL.
</p>

<p>
Once we have tidy data, an (often repeated) sub-process begins:
"transform" refers to any operation on the dataset that helps us
understand the data better. Depending on the size of the data
tables, we will use different methods of visualization to make
underlying structure visible. But visualization does not always have
to be graphical. Let's look at three examples in the next section.

<li><a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Apache Hadoop,</a> a "software library framework that allows for the
distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of
computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale
up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering
local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to
deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect
and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a
highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of
which may be prone to failures." (Source: Apache.org)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ibm.com/analytics/hadoop/mapreduce">MapReduce</a>, "a programming paradigm that enables massive scalability
across hundreds or thousands of servers in a Hadoop cluster. As the
processing component, MapReduce is the heart of Apache Hadoop. The
term "MapReduce" refers to two separate and distinct tasks that
Hadoop programs perform. The first is the map job, which takes a
set of data and converts it into another set of data, where
individual elements are broken down into tuples (key/value
pairs). The reduce job takes the output from a map as input and
combines those data tuples into a smaller set of tuples. As the
sequence of the name MapReduce implies, the reduce job is always
performed after the map job."  Source: IBM. See also:

<li><a href="https://pig.apache.org/">Apache Pig</a>, "a platform for analyzing large data sets that
consists of a high-level language for expressing data analysis
programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these
programs. The salient property of Pig programs is that their
structure is amenable to substantial parallelization, which in
turns enables them to handle very large data sets. At the present
time, Pig's infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that
produces sequences of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale
parallel implementations already exist (e.g., the Hadoop
subproject). Pig's language layer currently consists of a textual
language called Pig Latin." Source: apache.org. <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/apache_pig/index.htm">Tutorialspoint</a>.</li>

<p>
Of these applications, only Git (not GitHub) is really absolutely
necessary for a professional data scientist working in teams. Though
a working knowledge of the principles behind all of them will be
very useful (especially if they come up in interviews). Hence, no
reason to be scared.

Other terms for what we're talking about here are: "number sense"
(in maths education), or "computational thinking" (in computer
science) or, more recently, "data literacy". All of these are
relatively new concepts, so feel free to speculate and make up your
own mind! Cp. <a href="#/slide-orga80b54d">Devlin 2017</a>

How do you feel about anything if doing it would turn you into a
monster? What kind of monster is Frankenstein (if you didn't read
the book or saw the film, I'll tell you: ugly but soulful, loveable

in mechanical terms?

Mathematics, especially statistics, programming and databases are
the skill-based disciplines that you need to master. Having said
that: "mastering" could easily take not one, but several life
times, and you need to begin somewhere. If you do this in earnest,
you'll soon find that you start learning faster and faster the more
connections with what you already know you can make.] Here is a
(free) book called, incidentally, "<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/jeh/book.pdf">Foundations of Data Science</a>"
(<a href="#/slide-org55820a3">Blum et al 2015, 466 p.</a>). It includes some geometry, graph theory,
linear algebra, markov chains, and a variety of algorithms for
"massive data problems" like streaming, sketching and sampling.

The figure (like the underlying article) targets business decisions
more than everyday decisions. For business decisions, taxonomies
exist, which are generally a lot more complicated than shown here,
see e.g. <a href="#/slide-orgd243d8e">Scherpereel 2006</a>.

<p>
On the surface, Wing's "Data Life Cycle" (2019) has a few more
steps (and it is also not a "cycle") - it does not use the
artificial (technical) term "tidy" but instead terms that can more
easily be understood by practitioners outside of data
science. Modeling is not addressed by Wing but instead she puts
"management" at the center of the process, right between
data-centric and (business) process-centric categories. Another
related process model you may have heard of is the "<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Design_Thinking_process_in_the_Chapters_Dialogue_project.png">design
thinking" process</a>, which plays an important role in innovation and
when solving so-called "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem">wicked problems</a>".

"The ability to write code" is still the "most basic, universal skill"
for a data scientist - which is why learning R is the focus of this
introductory course. There are many data science programs at
universities now - often offered as minors or as Masters programs for
people trained already in maths, computer science, or fields with
obvious and current data science applications (like biology). The
understanding of a data scientist as a hybrid professional has not
really changed sinc
