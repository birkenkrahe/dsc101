## TODO Reading assignment (by Thu 26 Aug, 1 PM)

Please read the seminal [article by Davenport and Patil (2012)](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AhEvK3qWokrvhsVoCA7lL4i7m16ElQ) until
Thursday - it's not difficult. Write down any questions you may
have. What do you think has changed (if anything) since 2012?


## Programming languages

Here is the admittedly rather obscure 1966 article ([Landin, 1966](#org2415b8b))
that begins with the existence of 700 programming languages
("1,700 special programming languages [&#x2026;] in over 700
application areas"), and proposes a language generation framework
centered on so-called "primitives"<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>. Wikipedia ([2021](#orgc4b6766)) lists around
300 "notable languages" today - another author reports that the
HOPL list counts 8,945 languages. This includes minor ones,
completely esoteric languages, dialects (e.g. Python 2 and Python
3), and markup languages. Given the number of natural languages
that were spoken or written at some time - 7,099 according to
[WorldAtlas](https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/how-many-languages-are-there-in-the-world.html), 2,000 alone on the African continent ([Michaels,
2019](#org0a06573)) - this isn't surprising.


## Video recording

A video recording of the "data science overview" lecture is
[available via YouTube](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6SfZh1-kWXk4Fg0V1zLj9xmoOo6P1Oq0). Ca. 60 min, recorded in October 2020. The
background is our Berlin apartment (now sold).


## Podcast

I mentioned the data science career book by Nolis and Robinson
([Manning, 2020](#orga967732)). Their first podcast episode (done to promote the
book) is called "[What is Data Science?](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8zMGQ3ZDlmMC9wb2RjYXN0L3Jzcw/episode/OThhN2RmN2MtNmFhMy00YmVlLTlmYjEtYjViN2ZhN2RjYjQx?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj-ssv-5K7sAhWW0oUKHSitB8YQkfYCegQIARAF)".

# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> In the 1960s, fuelled by Chomsky's studies, it was believed that
there was a universal grammar of all languages. Figuring it out meant
that one could, for example, build an automatic translator
easily. This formalization of language has since turned out to be a
complete dead-end street. A few years ago, Chomsky and other prominent
linguists admitted that there were today, more than 50 years later,
still had no clue what language really is or where it came from
([Hauser et al, 2014](#orgb883285)).
