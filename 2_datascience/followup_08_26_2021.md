## Reading assignment - Davenport and Patil (2012)

-   LinkedIn today: 756 mio accounts ([source](https://www.omnicoreagency.com/LinkedIn-statistics/)). No. 1 corporate
    social media usage site in 2021 ([source](https://influencermarketinghub.com/linkedin-stats/)).
-   Goldman wanted to "capitalize on heuristics" - what's that?
-   Type of article: case study.

> "The case study approach allows in-depth, multi-faceted
> explorations of complex issues in their real-life settings. The
> value of the case study approach is well recognised in the fields
> of business, law and policy." ([Source](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3141799/))

-   "People-you-may-know-ads" click-through-rate (CTR) of 30%. How
    good is that? What's the benchmark? ([2016 averages for Google
    AdWords](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/02/29/google-adwords-industry-benchmarks)<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>)
-   "LinkedIn's growth trajectory shifted significantly upwards." By
    how much? ([2009-2021 data](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/linkedin-statistics/) do not confirm or deny that).
-   Big data opportunity: Why conditional on data in a form "other
    than in rows and columns of numbers" (i.e. tables)?

> "If your organization stores multiple petabytes of data, if
> the information most critical to your business resides in forms
> other than rows and columns of numbers, or if answering your
> biggest question would involve a “mashup” of several analytical
> efforts, you’ve got a big data opportunity."

-   Page 4 describes the data science pipeline or process that is
    still pretty much unchallenged in the industry.
-   Making one's own tools and conduct "academic-style research"
    (what does that mean?)
-   Changes since 2012? (Highlighting is mine)

> "Data scientists’ most basic,universal skill is the ability to
> **write code**. This may be less true in five years’ time, when many
> more people will have the title“data scientist” on their business
> cards. More enduring will be the need for data scientists to
> **communicate** in language that all their stakeholders
> understand—and to demonstrate the special skills involved in
> **storytelling with data**, whether verbally, visually,
> or—ideally—both&#x2026;the dominant trait is an intense **curiosity**."

-   What's scientific about data science?
-   Hiring criteria: "solid foundation in math, statistics,
    probability, and computer science, a feel for business issues
    and empathy for customers." How likely is it that a scientist
    has these qualities? How likely is it that a non-scientist has
    them? (E.g. an expert saleswoman, or a product manager in
    finance).
-   Degrees are typically at graduate (Master) level.
-   Issues: wanting to be "on the [Star Trek] bridge" but having to
    clean data instead all day long.
-   Comparison 1980s and 1990s: [Wall Street quants](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/08/quants-quantitative-analyst.asp) (quantitative
    analysts, quant geeks) - implement complex pricing models.
-   Other differences: Google competitions, emphasis on machine
    learning and AI, general confusion about the field has grown.

> "Think of big data as an epic wave gathering now, starting to
> crest. If you want to catch it, you need people who can surf."


# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Google Adwords is a pay-per-click live auction advertising
program where the ads are free but Google charges for clicks on your
ad. It's an auction because click prices are determined by the amount
of competition ([Source](https://www.freshbooks.com/hub/marketing/how-does-google-adwords-work)).
