### Reading assignment - Davenport and Patil (2012)

-   LinkedIn today: 756 mio accounts. No. 1 corporate social media
    usage site in 2021, which means that LinkedIn really has the
    attention of the industry ([Geyser, 2021](#orgbef7cf8)).
-   Goldman wanted to "capitalize on heuristics" - what's that?
-   Type of article: case study.

> "The case study approach allows in-depth, multi-faceted
> explorations of complex issues in their real-life settings. The
> value of the case study approach is well recognised in the fields
> of business, law and policy." ([Crowe et al, 2011](#org215e269)).

-   "People-you-may-know-ads" click-through-rate (CTR) of 30%. How
    good is that? What's the benchmark? Cp. 2016 averages fo Google
    AdWords ([Irvine, 2021](#org375ce64))<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>.
-   "LinkedIn's growth trajectory shifted significantly upwards." By
    how much? [2009-2021 data](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/linkedin-statistics/) do not confirm or deny that ([Iqbal, 2021](#org4c221ca)).
-   Big data opportunity: Why conditional on data in a form "other
    than in rows and columns of numbers" (i.e. tables)?

> "If your organization stores multiple petabytes of data, if
> the information most critical to your business resides in forms
> other than rows and columns of numbers, or if answering your
> biggest question would involve a “mashup” of several analytical
> efforts, you’ve got a big data opportunity."

-   Page 4 describes the data science pipeline or process that is
    still pretty much unchallenged in the industry.
-   Making one's own tools and conduct "academic-style research"
    (what does that mean?)
-   Changes since 2012? (Highlighting is mine)

> "Data scientists’ most basic,universal skill is the ability to
> **write code**. This may be less true in five years’ time, when many
> more people will have the title“data scientist” on their business
> cards. More enduring will be the need for data scientists to
> **communicate** in language that all their stakeholders
> understand—and to demonstrate the special skills involved in
> **storytelling with data**, whether verbally, visually,
> or—ideally—both&#x2026;the dominant trait is an intense **curiosity**."

-   What's scientific about data science?
-   Hiring criteria: "solid foundation in math, statistics,
    probability, and computer science, a feel for business issues
    and empathy for customers." How likely is it that a scientist
    has these qualities? How likely is it that a non-scientist has
    them? (E.g. an expert saleswoman, or a product manager in
    finance).
-   Degrees are typically at graduate (Master) level.
-   Issues: wanting to be "on the [Star Trek] bridge" but having to
    clean data instead all day long.
-   Comparison 1980s and 1990s: [Wall Street quants](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financialcareers/08/quants-quantitative-analyst.asp) aka quantitative
    analysts, or quant geeks ([Yates, 2020](#org1e97745)) - implement complex pricing models.
-   Other differences: Google competitions, emphasis on machine
    learning and AI, general confusion about the field has grown.

> "Think of big data as an epic wave gathering now, starting to
> crest. If you want to catch it, you need people who can surf."


### EDA project process

Three processes are aligned with one another for the project,
which in this course is an Exploratory Data Analysis, an EDA
project ([cp. Syllabus](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/blob/main/syllabus.md#grading-system)):

1.  term: beginning mid August, ending in early December. Mid-term
    grades are independent of the project.
2.  Scrum: four sprints with four sprint reviews roughly four weeks
    apart. at a sprint review, you present the status of your essay
    prototype.
3.  IMRaD: the introduction with research question (what you wish
    to investigate), the method (how you are going to do it), your
    results (what you found out), and the discussion of your
    results (what it means, how it benefits whom, including the
    limitations of your investigation).

In week 3 (Aug 30-Sep 3) we will focus on generating ideas and get
the project set up properly (1st sprint review). [See also the FAQs](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/FAQ.md)

-   "What is a sprint review",
-   "What do I need to deliver at a sprint review?"
-   "What should we do in the first sprint?"
-   "What should we do in the second sprint?"
-   "What should we do in the third sprint?"
-   "What should we do in the fourth sprint?"

# Footnotes

<sup><a id="fn.1" href="#fnr.1">1</a></sup> Google Adwords is a pay-per-click live auction advertising
program where the ads are free but Google charges for clicks on your
ad. It's an auction because click prices are determined by the amount
of competition ([source](#org79c9775)).
