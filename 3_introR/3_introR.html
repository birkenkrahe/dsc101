<p>
When it comes to "self-service" data analysis, three languages are
mentioned most often: R, Python and SQL. All three have their
relative merits and issues.
</p>

<p>
I chose R as the programming language for this introductory
course. The choice is partly personal and professional. Personal: I
like it and it's new for me (I only began to learn it in 2020), so I
am still excited about it. It's good if your instructor is excited
about the material! Professional: as business professionals, you
don't want to have to be programmers. At the same time, you need to
be able to speak with experts and do and extend your own analyses
(not be restricted for example by dashboards).
</p>

<p>
On a practical note, R has a very large, diverse user and developer
community. Unlike Python, many of the users do not have a technology
background. This means that the "world of R" is more easily
accessible if digital technologies and programming aren't your main
interests. The SQL community is probably even larger and even more
diverse (databases being a more general interest than even
statistical analysis), but the language SQL itself is hardly
extensible, very focused on querying and less on visualization.
</p>

<p>
In reality, as a data scientist, or even as a business practitioner
with serious, systematic data analytics interests, you need to know
all of these - R, SQL, and Python. Here, we'll start with R.
</p>

<p>
For a direct comparison of Python and R for data cleaning and
exploratory analysis with examples, see e.g. <a href="#/slide-org6bbd0ae">Radecic (2020)</a>, <a href="#/slide-org60d8276">Uprety
(2020)</a> and <a href="#/slide-org27c7e2f">Shotwell (2020)</a>. To see how R outperforms Python, see
<a href="#/slide-org0240838">Grogan (2020)</a>. To see some equivalents of SQL in R, check ODSC
(2018). And for an overview of data science tools beyond Python, R,
and SQL, see <a href="#/slide-orgad63a5f">Gallatin (2018)</a>. And here's a neat <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/r-or-python-for-data-analysis">infographic</a> from
datacamp comparing both for data analysis.
</p>

<p>
There are downsides to using R as well, of course, and it has been
called "hard to learn", too (<a href="#/slide-org34d4bc9">Muenchen 2017</a>), partly and
paradoxically because the language is so flexible and
extensible. Also, some innovations, like the Tidyverse, aren't
necessarily good for beginners (<a href="#/slide-orga0e8863">Matloff 2019</a>).
</p>

<p>
Of course, there's also always an index - in this case the "TIOBE"
index of programming language popularity (based on the languages
people search for), see figure <a href="#/slide-orgc34683c">1</a>. As you can see, R improved
its position in one year from 20th to 8th. That's by far the
strongest improvement of any language among the top 10. Still,
Python is three times more search-successful. Neither Python nor SQL
have changed their position compared to one year ago. The popularity
of R quite likely rides on the popularity of statistics due to the
interest in COVID-19 data analysis.

I tried this on a Lenovo laptop running Windows 10 and it worked
well:
</p>
<ul>
<li>After opening the <code>R..win.exe</code> file, a popup asks you if you will
let this pogram modify your hard disk. Say "yes" (why is this
necessary?<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1">1</a></sup>)</li>
<li>In the installation dialog, accept all settings and check the
options for establishing a desktop shortcut and a quick launch
icon.</li>
<li>The location of your R program files will be <code>C:\Program
     Files\R</code>. Once the installation is finished, you should have an
icon on your desktop named <code>Rx64 4.0.2</code> (or whatever your version
is).</li>
<li>Double click it to open the R console for the first time. At the
<code>&gt;</code> prompt, type <code>1+1</code> and <code>RETURN</code> to see if R can compute. Then
type <code>demo(graphics)</code> and hit <code>RETURN</code> ("<code>Enter</code>") repeatedly to
see a few R plots.</li>
<li>I also switched from my integrated (default) graphics card to a
"High Performance NVIDIA" graphics card (which I did not know I
had!).</li>
<li>To leave, type <code>q()</code> at the prompt or leave with the <code>File &gt; Exit</code>
graphical menu. When asked if you wish to save the workspace, say
"no".</li>
<li>When installing a program, a dialog was opened offering me to
install packages in a local folder (accept this with "yes").</li>

</ul>

</ul>

<p>
I did this on a MacMini (2014) running MacOS 10.13.6 without too
many problems (see below). Essentially the only problem occurred
when trying to install packages (discussed later) and I could fix it
easily by changing a system setting.
</p>
<ul>
<li>To download and install R for MacOS, go to <code>r-project.org</code>, and
click on <code>CRAN</code> right below the <code>Download</code> headline. The CRAN
mirror page opens. Scroll down to find a German mirror site and
click to download the <code>.DMG</code> installer file, which will install
the program.</li>
<li><p>
There were system-level error messages though the program
installed alright. But I could not install CRAN packages because
of this error:
</p>

<p>
<code>tar: Failed to set default locale</code>
</p>

<p>
This refers to a problem with the <code>tar</code> unzip program. I checked
<code>stackoverflow.com</code> and found a fix that in turn directed me back
to a <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/RMacOSX-FAQ.html#Internationalization-of-the-R_002eapp">CRAN helpfile</a> with lots (too much, really) information for
Mac users.
</p></li>
<li><p>
To fix the problem, close R, open a terminal and type:
</p>

<p>
<code>defaults write org.R-project.R force.LANG en_US.UTF-8</code>
</p>

<p>
Then restart R and the problem should have disappeared (it did
for me and never came back).

Ubuntu Linux operating system e.g. has the version number 18.04-LTS
and the name "Bionic Beaver"). R 4.0.2 is also called "Taking Off

As you'll find out when following the instructions in figure

distributed "under the terms of the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html">GNU General Public License</a>"
(GPL). Popular software also distributed under the GPL include the
Linux "kernel" (the core of the operating system), and the GNU
compiler collection. You may have heard of the term "open source",
which essentially means the same thing, though one may quibble (and
<a href="https://opensource.com/article/17/11/open-source-or-free-software">people do, a lot</a>). What's important to remember: use of the GPL (=
making R "free software") has contributed enormously to the success
of this language.

Behind R is a large project of volunteers (figure <a href="#/slide-org9d8a525">9</a>. At it
centre is the "R Core Group" of developers. Because R is part of
the "GNU suite" of programs, and because its predecessor was called
S, it is also sometimes called "GNU S". <a href="#/slide-org04f7faa">Becker (2004)</a> has written
an interesting historical account of S. When using R for analysis
in a thesis, a paper, an essay or a blog post, one should cite it
as a source. This is what the code <code>citation()</code> is for. Same goes
for specific packages (more on this later) like "<code>data.table</code>" that
are not part of Base-R. The citation alternatives may also prompt
you to check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX"><code>LaTeX</code></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX"><code>BibTeX</code></a>, which are quasi-standards

<ul>
<li>Enter <code>demo(graphics)</code> and marvel.</li>
<li>Enter <code>help.start()</code> - where is this page?</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
The section higlighted in figure <a href="#/slide-orga0e388c">10</a> suggests a few commands
that you ought to try for yourself:
</p>

<p>
<code>help()</code> is a function to get help for whatever you put in between
the brackets. A quick win is <code>help(help)</code>, or help about the help
function. The format of the help pages is borrowed from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page">Unix
man[ual] pages</a>. An alternative to <code>help()</code> is <code>?</code> followed by the
term you need help with, e.g. <code>?help</code>, which is the same as
<code>help(help)</code> but much shorter. Lastly, <code>help.start()</code> opens a
browser window with help in HTML format. Very useful access to a
wealth of systematic information. If you don't know the exact name,
you can also search across all documentation using <code>help.search()</code>
or the shortcut <code>??</code>. Try entering <code>??cars</code> if you are looking for
datasets on cars. You'll find that there are four known datasets
with cars in different packages.
</p>

<p>
Via the dataset search, you can also find out that functions like
<code>help()</code> or <code>demo()</code> are part of the <code>utils</code> package - respective
functions are listed as <code>utils::[function]</code>. It contains all sorts
of functions for housekeeping and administration.
</p>

<p>
The R help system is however not written for beginners. Personally,
I more often go to textbooks or, preferably, to stackoverflow.com if
I have a question or need to remind myself of a command or a way of
doing things.
</p>

<p>
There are a few interactive demo programs available, too. You should
try <code>demo(graphics)</code> and marvel at the various possibilities of R to
create plots with your data. Notice how few lines of code are
sufficient to create great effects! The window that opens when you
execute the demo commands is the standard graphics output when using R
in command-line mode.

<ul>
<li>Enter <code>getwd()</code> ("get working dir")</li>
<li>Use <code>setwd()</code> to change directory</li>

</ul>

<aside class="notes">
<p>
When you start R, you may be asked, which working directory you wish
to use. This is where all files created (e.g. plots) will be put and
where R will look first to load scripts with R commands for execution.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/getwd"><code>setwd()</code></a> command in figure <a href="#/slide-org1e8808d">11</a> allows you to set any
directory as working directory. To check which one is used right
now, you can use <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/getwd"><code>getwd()</code></a>.
</p>

<p>
How you specify the path to the current working directory depends on
your operating system, e.g. <code>/home/marcus</code> for my home directory on
MacOS/Linux, or <code>C:\Users\Marcus</code> under Windows. Especially as a
Windows user, you should look at your file organisation - this will
pay off as soon as you use the terminal or command-line. The Bash
shell that I use on my Linux computer (and that most MacOS users
will use) is also available within Windows 10 <a href="#/slide-org74e058d">(Posey 2018</a>).

and how you can do it. One of the advantages of working on the
command-line is that you experience how you can adapt your working
environment to your personal needs - something that most graphical
environments do not allow you do to (at least not without a lot more
effort). Freedom of extensibility is the name of the command-line
game.

One of the advantages of the interactive command-line is the ability
to perform arithmetic operations. In figure <a href="#/slide-org2e1bc34">13</a> we begin with
a simple addition. We'll do a lot more of this in the next
section. When you type the command and click <code>ENTER</code>, R responds by
printing out the result without the need to explicit instruct it
using a <code>print</code> command (though as you can see, this works as
well). You also see here that <code>#</code> is the R sign for a comment (which
is ignored upon execution). The ominous <code>[1]</code> at the beginning of
each output line indicates the number of columns printed. R does
this because it is strongest when manipulating tabular data - data
ordered in columns and rows.

<p>
R packages are collections of functions and datasets that are ready
for you to use. You only have to install them (from repositories
like CRAN), and load them (once they are installed) with
<code>library()</code>, as shown in figure <a href="#/slide-org871a36b">15</a> for an already installed
package, <code>MASS</code>. The ability to create and use packages easily is
one of the main reasons for the popularity of R and an illustration
of its extensibility. Figure <a href="#/slide-org871a36b">15</a> also shows the installation
of a package (<code>ks</code>) - or rather, only the beginning of the
installation output. Once downloaded, the package needs to be
compiled for your system, which, for large packages, can take
several minutes. A successful installation should end with
<code>Done([name])</code>, e.g. <code>Done(ks)</code> in the example. Packages are updated
regularly. To update your packages, you need to enter
<code>update.packages()</code>. For a short description of a package, use
<code>packageDescription("[name]"]</code>. To see all your installed packages,
use <code>installed.packages()</code> (this might result in a very long
list). For a listing of all functions and datasets in a package, use
<code>help(package="[name]")</code>, e.g. <code>help(package="MASS")</code>. To see all
built-in datasets (that come with base-R, the basic R program), enter
<code>data()</code>.

"MASS" comes from the title of the book "Modern Applied Statistics
with S" (freely available <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224817420_Modern_Applied_Statistics_With_S">via researchgate.net</a>).
</p>

<p>
Works for R and for its predecessor S.
</p>

<p>
»S is a language and environment for data analysis originally
developed at Bell Laboratories (of AT&amp;T and now Lucent
Technologies). It became the statisti-cian's calculator for the 1990s,
allowing easy access to the computing power and graphical capabilities
of modem workstations and personal computers. Various implementations
have been available, currently S-PLUS, a commercial system from the
Insightful Corporation1 in Seattle, and R,2 an Open Source system
writ-ten by a team of volunteers. Both can be run on Windows and a
range of UNIX / Linux operating systems: R also runs on Macintoshes.«

<aside class="notes">
<p>
You've seen that I don't just cite peer-reviewed papers but blog
posts, too. The truth is that I have personally learnt a lot more
from them than from scientific papers. However, this is partly a
function of my experience and skill. Without these, it might be hard
to distinguish what's good and bad - just like when you google any
topic you don't know anything about yet. But even if you're a bloody
beginner, I recommend reading widely and both deeply (with a lot of
focus, e.g. when looking up terms, repeating analyses and retyping
code) and shallowly (skimming articles, reading comments), because
you build an associative network of terms, arguments and
practices. I follow a bunch of data science experts on <a href="https://twitter.com/birkenkrahe">Twitter</a> for
the same reason. If you do this for any topic that is being
discussed on a factual (rather than an overly political or
emotional) basis, you'll learn more faster<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2">2</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
For example: take a look at "<a href="https://rweekly.org/">R Weekly</a>" for a weekly, curated
collection of articles from the R community. This will give you an
idea of the spread of information.

To understand why you should play (see figure <a href="#/slide-orgf72a726">26</a>), check the
article by an active blogger and professional in the R-blogosphere,
Keith McNulty, who leads data science at the global strategy
consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co. He argues that "learning through
playing around" with the software is a good way to learn (<a href="#/slide-orgf31115e">McNulty
2020</a>) - I agree. Though I am often distracted by having to create
teaching material for you, playing around on or off the
command-line, looking at interesting data and combing through them
using the analytical tools R offers, or checking other people's
plots or inferences, is the most fun way of learning R. There's
nothing wrong with reading or working through a course, watching
teaching videos, of course, either.

list!) are divided in applications and infrastructure
projects. <b>Applications</b> of R include bioinformatics (e.g. in the
medical sciences or in genomics), geospatial statistics (anything
related to maps), and finance (R is strong with this
one!). <b>Infrastructure</b> includes incorporation of R in Wikis (like
Wikipedia) - for example to generate plots on the fly - and ESS
("Emacs Speaks Statistics"), which is the interface to the
extensible text editor that I'm using (e.g. to create all
documentation for this course - essentially from one text file). An
alternative to ESS is the highly popular IDE (Integrated
Development Environment) RStudio. We will not be using it in this
course but I encourage you to check it out, try it and see if you
like it, especially if my teaching tempo is too slow for you!

<h3 id="org80d650c">The R Project</h3>
<p>
<a id="org10345fb"></a> There is no special connection between LaTeX and R,
except that both are free software programs, one for formatting
(especially when mathematical formulas need to be presented), the
other one for statistical calculations and visualisation. However,
to communicate data analysis results and to make the analysis
process itself reproducible, a combination between these two goals
(formatting/programming) is desirable. This is exactly what
"literate programming" (<a href="#/slide-org908e160">Knuth 1984</a>) does. There is also a program called "R
Markdown" to create documents that enables you e.g.  to created
HTML, PDF, ePUB and Kindle books with only one source. You can find
examples at <a href="https://bookdown.org/">bookdown.org</a>. See also <a href="#/slide-org8f559e4">Zeng (2018)</a> for a brief
introduction to both R and LateX - sufficient to get started -
written apparently as a minimal example for bookdown. For LaTeX
there are also cloud editors like <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">overleaf.com</a>.
</p>
</section>
<section id="slide-orgc087248">
<h3 id="orgc087248">R Packages</h3>
<p>
<a id="org58ecb41"></a> You can directly search for this dataset - I usually
take the search string "<code>r doc [name]</code>, in this case <code>r doc MASS
   boston</code>, which gets me straight <a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/MASS/versions/7.3-52/topics/Boston">to this page</a>. At the top, you can
read that "The <code>Boston</code> data frame has 506 rows and 14
columns". There's also an R Notebook, which shows various aspects
of this dataset.
</p>

<p>
Another way to find the answer is by using the command <code>str()</code> that
you already know: <code>str(Boston</code> contains the answer in the first
line - as long as <code>MASS</code> has been loaded. (Check out what happens
if not by closing the R session with <code>q()</code> (don't save the
workspace) and reopening it again.
</p>

<p>
The simplest way is to type <code>help(Boston)</code> (again, only after
loading the <code>MASS</code> package).
