* What is this?

  This is a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) file for the course DSC
  101. For the FAQs across courses, see the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org][org repo]].

* Which textbooks can you recommend to learn R?

  1) The recommended resource is "[[https://github.com/matloff/fasteR#faster-fast-lane-to-learning-r][fasteR]]", which is on GitHub and it
     is free (you can clone it to your computer, or fork it to your
     GitHub account).

  2) "The Art of R Programming - A Tour of Statistical Software
     Design", by Norman Matloff, NoStarch Press (2011). You can find
     it [[https://archive.org/details/Norman_Matloff___The_Art_of_R_Programming][online at the Internet Archive]] (I recommend buying it - a
     wonderful text). It is not for absolute beginners to programming,
     but it introduces R and statistics with R.
     
  3) In class, also showed a book by Irizarry "Introduction to Data
     Science", CRC Press 2020, also available for free [[https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/][online
     here]]. We'll cover about 1/3 of the book (part I + II) in this
     first course. However, there are some issues with this book.
     
  4) Two more excellent books that I have used, more about R and stats
     than about data science perhaps, are T M Davies' "The Book of R"
     (NoStarch Press, 2016), and R Cotton's "Learning R" (O'Reilly,
     2013). 'The Book of R' is the main textbook from fall 2022.

     There is any number of books available, many online for free,
     available e.g. at [[https://bookdown.org/][bookdown.org]]. These books often focus on the
     "Tidyverse" packages for R, which I think is not suitable for
     beginners ([[https://github.com/matloff/TidyverseSkeptic][see here]] for an explanation why).

     If you find a text or a book, or a tutorial that you really like,
     please share the information with us!

* Are we going to use RStudio?

  No. [[https://rstudio.com/][RStudio]] is worth checking out, and it may well be what you use
  later in your data science career, but I think it is much too
  complex for beginners, and not really necessary at all.

  RStudio is a so-called "IDE" (Integrated Development Environment) -
  it presents a file editor (to create R programs, or notebooks), an R
  console (to enter commands interactively), a graphical output device
  (for plots), a file explorer, and an environment explorer (for
  loaded variables etc.), and more. It's a tool created for
  professionals and developers of packages[fn:1].

  I want you to focus on the basics. As a beginner, this will serve
  you best, I believe. It's a little like learning to drive on gear
  shift, and then upgrading to automatic transmission.

  I will however, show you RStudio, and we will also use it together
  (optionally) during the session on "Literate Programming".

  If you want to install RStudio on your computer, here is an
  excellent [[https://techvidvan.com/tutorials/install-r/][beginner's tutorial]].

* Which editor and IDE do you use?
  I use the free [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] editor. For R, I use Emacs + [[https://ess.r-project.org/][ESS]] ("Emacs Speaks
  Statistics"), for general notebooking and task management
  and...everything really, I use Emacs + ESS + [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] (a
  general-purpose task manager inside Emacs, first developed by
  physicists like me). For slides, I use the [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/][reveal.js]] (JavaScript)
  framework (generates HTML), or [[https://github.com/takaxp/org-tree-slide][org-tree-slide]] (for presenting
  straight from Org-mode).

  Emacs is hands down the best editor in the world, written in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)][LISP]][fn:2],
  one of the earliest programming languages for AI research, and the
  second oldest language in widespread use (after FORTRAN).

  They say the learning curve of this "complex beast" ([[https://masteringemacs.org/article/beginners-guide-to-emacs][Petersen, 2019]])
  is steep but don't believe it.  Here is an link to [[https://opensource.com/article/20/3/getting-started-emacs][get started with
  Emacs easily]] (Kenlon, 2019). Tale a look!

  Here is a 2021 "[[https://ess-intro.github.io/][Introduction to Emacs Speaks Statistics]]" site with
  lots of additional information.

  panels inside the editor

* What are the instructions for the final presentation?
  These are the instructions[fn:3] for handing in the final
  presentation of your data science term team project. Please read them
  carefully, follow them to the letter and contact me immediately if
  there are issues or mistakes[fn:4]. Submit earlier, not in the last
  minute, to be on the safe side!

  The deadline for submitting the presentation is *December 5, 12AM
  CST* (Sunday midnight in Batesville).

  1) *Fill in and sign* [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/Honor_pledge.pdf][this honor sheet (PDF)]] and write
     *"pledged"* next to your name in the column "Honor Pledge".

  2) Upload your *presentation documents* and the *scan of the
     signed honor sheet* [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/tree/main/presentations/4_sprint_review][to this GitHub folder]] - please add your
     name(s) to the title of the file. If you submit more than one
     file (e.g. notebook etc.) please create a folder!

  3) Post the *link* to your video presentation [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/discussions][to the discussion
     forum]] in GitHub[fn:5]. Test the link before posting it!

  4) When you're done, *send me an email* (birkenkrahe@lyon.edu)
     confirming that you've done all of this, including which
     course you're in (DSC 101).

  5) Await my formative (comments) and summative (grade) feedback
     (via email) based on [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/Presentation_Assessment_Form.pdf][this presentation assessment form]] (PDF).

     Cheers, and have a good Thanksgiving break & a successful exam
     period!  Marcus Birkenkrahe

  PS. There is no strict upper or lower time limit for your
  presentation. Take all the time that you need to answer your
  research question. Also, you submit as a team if you worked on the
  project as a team - I don't care who gives the presentation,
  i.e. how you split the work up among yourselves. Formally, you can
  create a screencast, make a real video, record yourself in
  powerpoint etc. - your choice of medium.

* How can I update R on my computer?

  * Why update? Because some packages won't work unless you upgrade
    base R, and also because the language changes and gets better.
  * The current version is "Bird Hippie" (4.1.2 - Nov 1) - check this
    by opening the R console, or by typing ~R --version~ in the
    terminal (command line).
  * You can update in the R GUI:

    #+attr_html: :width 400px
    [[./img/update.jpg]]

    * Or you can update in the R console itself (after starting R)
      either with ~RGui~ or ~RTerm~:

[fn:3] This text will be available here: Update in Schoology, Email to
participants, FAQ in GitHub (AI).

[fn:4]Please be advised that I'm traveling in Europe between November
29 and December 15 (communication of final grades), and will not be
easily reachable.

[fn:5]Start a ~New discussion~ and make sure that your name(s) appear
in the subject line of the post. Do *not post the video itself* since
GitHub has limited space available. Use GDrive, Vimeo or YouTube
(unlisted) instead.

[fn:2]Actually, Emacs is written in a dialect of Lisp, EmacsLisp
(Elisp), and it is also the language in which Emacs can be customized,
which is one of its greatest advantages (it's a totally extensible
editor - unlike all the other IDEs and GUI-tools that you use). [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LearnEmacsLisp][Elisp
is easy to learn]].

[fn:1]It is unfortunate, that people (usually newbies) believe that "R
= RStudio = Tidyverse". This has to do with the great marketing
successes of RStudio (the company behind the product). Don't get me
wrong: there are many wonderful things about RStudio (e.g. it's Open
source). But you don't need it and it has a "lock-in" effect. I
e.g. use *Emacs + ESS + Org-mode* instead, but I also would not
recommend it for beginners.
