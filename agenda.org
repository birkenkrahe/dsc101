[fn:7]In this overview course, you meet base R graphics, which is a
very powerful toolbox to create plots and communicate your message
using graphs. In class, we may look at some extra plot types, and you
can complete this excellent DataCamp course on your own!

[fn:6]Since a few years, Kaggle, the competition platform owned by
Google, publishes meta data about data science and invites everyone to
construct data-driven narratives about the field. The results are
quite fun - and DataCamp has turned the 2017 survey into a mini
project, which is fairly easy to follow. Unfortunately, it's
"tidyverse" infused. I'd like to recreate this project without the
need for "tidyverse" intervention.

[fn:5]Some advice on doing online exercises: THINK THINGS THROUGH FOR
YOURSELF! Don't just go through the motions. There's plenty to learn
that DataCamp never tells you. For now, make ample use of ~help()~!

[fn:4]Hopefully, you remember that your DataCamp completion rate makes
up 15% of your total grade ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/blob/main/syllabus.org#datacamp-assignments-15][see syllabus]]).

[fn:3]What's the project idea? The article has no references, only
claims. Your project would be to contrast Excel and R using one or
more simple examples. An example could come from some other class.

[fn:2]What's the project idea here? The blog post describes the model
purely in terms of R (very easy to play through actually - do it!). It
does not provide any of the mathematics. A project could write about
this with references (missing in the blog) and maths, and present this
topic more systematically. The maths are pure probability 101, quite
simple.

[fn:1]What's the project idea here? Understand how the adventure game is
built, program your own (different) game and document the process and
the result. Nice presentation opportunity: you can let your audience
play the game and perhaps gather statistics, too.
