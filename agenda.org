  [[./img/outlander.gif]]

  * Keep up with your *project* work!
  * Short midterm *exam* on Thu Sept 30!
  * Includes *everything* esp. DataCamp
  * Class on Thursday September 23 cancelled!

* Footnotes

[fn:5]Some advice on doing online exercises: THINK THINGS THROUGH FOR
YOURSELF! Don't just go through the motions. There's plenty to learn
that DataCamp never tells you. For now, make ample use of ~help()~!

[fn:4]Hopefully, you remember that your DataCamp completion rate makes
up 15% of your total grade ([[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/blob/main/syllabus.org#datacamp-assignments-15][see syllabus]]).

[fn:3]What's the project idea? The article has no references, only
claims. Your project would be to contrast Excel and R using one or
more simple examples. An example could come from some other class.

[fn:2]What's the project idea here? The blog post describes the model
purely in terms of R (very easy to play through actually - do it!). It
does not provide any of the mathematics. A project could write about
this with references (missing in the blog) and maths, and present this
topic more systematically. The maths are pure probability 101, quite
simple.

[fn:1]What's the project idea here? Understand how the adventure game is
built, program your own (different) game and document the process and
the result. Nice presentation opportunity: you can let your audience
play the game and perhaps gather statistics, too.
