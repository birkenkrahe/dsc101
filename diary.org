* What is this?

  A place for irregular articles of possible interest to students of
  the DSC 101 course, mostly to avoid lengthy emails and to park
  content that I may want to develop later on time permitting.

* Redrawing Google trend chart (07-13-2021)

  Spent an afternoon rekindling some skills. Mean to show this during
  the introduction to datascience lecture but I probably won't get
  to. All of this started with this [[https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=data%20science,machine%20learning][infographic]] from Google's trend
  graph generator. I wanted to reproduce it using R, which took a
  couple of hours because I was quite out of shape.[fn:3]

** The original from ~trends.google.com~

   #+attr_html: :width 600px
   [[./img/trends_google.png]]

** Recreated trends from raw data

   Here are the results of recreating the graphs using ~plot()~ from
   raw data. The code for each is below.

   You can download the raw data from the ~trends.google.com~
   website. You should look at it first - the format can be
   different from what I'm assuming here: there should be three
   columns, two numeric (relative interest over time for "data
   science", and for "machine learning"), and one character (the
   date). In my downloaded file, there was an extra line
   (~"Category: All categories"~), which I deleted manually.

*** Scatterplot

    [[./img/trends.png]]

*** Barplot

    #+attr_html: :width 600px
    [[./img/avg.png]]

** Scatterplot code

*** Download dataset as ~csv~ file

    Look at dataset: first two lines are spurious. Delete by hand so
    that the header line (column names) is the first line of the
    table:

    #+begin_example
 Category: All categories

 Month,Data science: (Worldwide),Machine learning: (Worldwide)
 2004-01,12,13
 2004-02,15,24
 2004-03,7,21
 2004-04,5,16
 2004-05,9,22
    #+end_example

*** Upload as data frame using ~read.table~

    To use the ~Month~ column as dates for a time series, turn
    ~trends$Month~ into date format Date conversion: this can be done
    with the ~anytime~ package which must be installed and loaded. I
    found out about this via [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44488439/format-year-month-to-posixct][stack.overflow]].

*** Create line plot

    Here is a [[https://www.statology.org/how-to-plot-multiple-lines-data-series-in-one-chart-in-r/][short tutorial]] on how to do this using the functions
    ~points()~, ~lines()~ and ~plot()~. The code is below.

**** Read data from CSV file

     #+begin_src R :session :exports both :results output
       ## read data from CSV file
       trends <- read.table(
           file="data/multiTimeline.csv",
           header=TRUE,
           sep=",")
       str(trends)
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     :
     : 'data.frame':    216 obs. of  3 variables:
     :  $ Month                        : chr  "2004-01" "2004-02" "2004-03" "2004-04" ...
     :  $ data.science...Worldwide.    : int  9 9 7 1 7 6 6 7 5 5 ...
     :  $ machine.learning...Worldwide.: int  13 22 16 17 22 16 28 12 22 18 ...

**** Rename column vectors

     I want the column vectors to have simple names.

     #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
       colnames(trends) <- c("month","ds","ml")
       str(trends)
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     :
     : 'data.frame':    216 obs. of  3 variables:
     :  $ month: chr  "2004-01" "2004-02" "2004-03" "2004-04" ...
     :  $ ds   : int  9 9 7 1 7 6 6 7 5 5 ...
     :  $ ml   : int  13 22 16 17 22 16 28 12 22 18 ...

**** Convert month column to ~Date~ format

     The ~anydate()~ function in the ~anytime~ package parses dates
     and returns a vector of ~Date~ objects. You have to install
     ~anytime~.

     #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
       library(anytime)
       month <- anydate(trends$month)
       str(month)
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     :
     :  Date[1:216], format: "2004-01-01" "2004-02-01" "2004-03-01" "2004-04-01" "2004-05-01" ...

     Now we substitute ~trends$month~ by the ~Date~-formatted vector
     ~month~.

     #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output
       trends <- cbind(trends[,-1], month)
       str(trends)
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     :
     : 'data.frame':    216 obs. of  3 variables:
     :  $ ds   : int  9 9 7 1 7 6 6 7 5 5 ...
     :  $ ml   : int  13 22 16 17 22 16 28 12 22 18 ...
     :  $ month: Date, format: "2004-01-01" "2004-02-01" ...

**** Plotting

     First, we plot the values for the "data science" search. The
     plotting window is limited by the maximum search values.

     Then we plot the values for the "machine learning" search over
     the existing plot using ~lines()~.

     Finally, we add a legend in the upper left corner.

     #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results output file graphics :file ./img/trends.png
       plot(x=trends$month,
            y=trends$ds,
            xlab="years",
            ylab="Interest",
            ylim=c(0,max(c(trends$ds,trends$ml))),
            type="l",
            lty=1,
            col="blue",
            main="trends.google.com search history")

       lines(x=trends$month,
             y=trends$ml,
             lty=2,
             col="red")

       legend(x=month[1],
              y=85,
              legend=c("data science","machine learning"),
              lty=c(1,2),
              col=c("blue","red"))
     #+end_src

     #+RESULTS:
     [[file:./img/trends.png]]


** Barplot   code

   For some simple examples, see this [[http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/bar-plots-r-base-graphs#basic-bar-plots][short tutorial]].

   We assume that the code above has already run, and that the data
   frame ~trends~ contains the required values to recreated the Google
   barplots.

   #+begin_src R :exports both :session :results file graphics :file ./img/avg.png
     barplot(height=c(mean(trends$ds),
                      mean(trends$ml)),
             names.arg=c("Data science","Machine learning"),
             ylab="Average interest (2004-2021)",
             col=c("blue","red"),
             main="trends.google.com search history")
   #+end_src

   #+RESULTS:
   [[file:./img/avg.png]]

* Data science process (07-15-2021)

  I was digging around my notes made for an online test lecture on May
  19, on "Exploring data with R" (see [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/blob/main/wiki/talk_presentation.pdf][presentation]] & [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/blob/main/wiki/talk_notes.pdf][notes]]), for an
  update on a [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/tree/main/2_datascience][data science overview lecture]]. For this talk, I had
  developed the model shown in figure [[fig:ds]]: there are two pathways
  towards machine learning. One pathway relied more on coding and
  algorithms (traditionally taught in CS programs), the other one
  relied more on modeling and heuristics (traditionally taught in
  maths and statistics programs).

  #+name: fig:ds
  [[./img/data_science.png]]

  The model suppresses a lot of detail, of course, in order to
  emphasize the contrast between coding and modeling, e.g. many
  applications outside of CS, e.g. bioinformatics in biology.

  It came straight out of two lines of thought: one related to the
  experience of a CS professor that some CS students with more than
  average interest in mathematics wanted to specialize on data
  science. The other one related to my experience with exploratory
  data analysis as a way of solving hard, data rich problems for real
  clients (see figure [[fig:eda]]).

  #+name: fig:eda
  [[./img/righteda.png]]

  I added this to the other two data science workflow images that I
  already had in the lecture. And I added yet another one (see figure
  [[fig:da]]), from a recent book on data analytics[fn:1]. I really like
  how everything comes back and returns to the "real world" here, and
  the feedback loop provided by the data analysis "pipeline".

  #+name: fig:da
  [[./img/ds_workflow.jpg]]

  This is interesting, because it emphasizes the origin of most data
  from (digital) devices and sees EDA as a way of making decisions
  using various techniques (discussed in the book). I don't like the
  emphasis on "decisions", since "making decisions" as such is not a
  priority (there is no alternative). I prefer the old-fashioned way
  of looking at *problems* and trying to find *solutions*. I've also
  used the trendy term "decision intelligence" (made popular by Google
  et al.), but I think it overplays both "decisions" and
  "intelligence".

  Most data science problems may not lead to decisions, to change or
  to anything worth calling "intelligent". This is probably because of
  my training as a physicist, though later I worked with business
  people, who like the "decisions" and "challenges" lines of argument
  more than "problems" and "solutions" - I can't even remember
  why. The prejudice back in the day when this lingo came up was that
  "problems" sound too much as if you had a problem, with negative
  connotations, while "challenges" sounded as if you were worthy of a
  challenge, I suppose. Pointless to argue, since everyone know what's
  what anyway - except perhaps newbies.

  Enough said. I extracted these figures from their context and added
  them to the lecture - will see in August if this makes any
  difference or not[fn:2].

* "Teaching the tidyverse in 2021" (09-07-2021)

  I've mentioned the "tidyverse" before. This morning, I read an
  article (posted in RWeekly, the weekly aggregator of R news that you
  should subscribe to) "Teaching the tidyverse in 2021"
  ([[tidy21][Cetinkaya-Rundel, 2021]]), which upset me. I will briefly explain
  why. The article mentions the 2020 series of the same title, which
  begins with the claim that "updates to tidyverse packages are
  specifically designed to make it easier for new learners to get
  started with doing data science in R." ([[tidy20][Cetinkaya-Rundel, 2020]]).

  Instead of a long rant (see Matloff's "TidyverseSceptic" for a
  complete picture of the criticism), just look at the first figure,
  which shows "the lifecycle stages of functions and packages in the
  tidyverse". This is not a bad diagram at all, and it makes my point:
  a beginner, a learner of R, someone who wants to do data science,
  should not have to learn about package development mechanics:
  "experimental" vs. "deprecated" vs. "superseded" vs. "stable" -
  What? Exactly.

  [[./img/lifecycle.png]]

  Reader, R beginner, let me tell you: there is no "tidyverse"
  beginner's approach to R. You may like it or leave it (I prefer to
  leave it, for a number of reasons, though you may need to know it),
  but it's not an alternate R universe, and it's not an alternative to
  base R, no matter how many times the creators and contributors of
  this package bundle may say so.

* Data or graph checking projects (10-07-2021)

  Many of the project proposals by the course participants are still
  much too complex for my taste - the research questions need to be
  cut down to doable size.

  Not simple but highly effective are projects that don't do anything
  else but check published data and their interpretation. I mentioned
  a student project from last term. This team of Master students
  focused on a graph published in The Economist. I have uploaded their
  final report "Improve Visualization of Popular Support for Executive
  Actions in the U.S." and the data ([[cai][Cai, Otlu and Rauenbusch,
  2021]]). It's a very good piece of work, created with a lot of effort
  over a period of three months. Less would easily do for our course.

  Here is a more recent data checking example that you might find
  interesting, by [[matloff21][Matloff (2021)]]. This highly opinionated data
  checking post uses statistical arguments to check policy
  decisions. From the conclusions:

  #+begin_quote
  "The much-vaunted failure rate reduction from 40% to 8%, is not borne
  out by the data at all. The district cannot or will not show the
  details of those numbers, and they concede the numbers are not
  consistent with the data that the district did provide."

  And here's a 2020 list of useful sites for [[https://towardsdatascience.com/useful-sites-for-finding-datasets-for-data-analysis-tasks-1edb8f26c34d][finding free, public
  datasets]] for EDA tasks.

* From the sickbed (11-02-2021)

  I've been too ill to teach for a couple of days (just a bad cold,
  nothing to worry about but still debilitating). This hasn't stopped
  me from hunting and gathering R examples. Here are a few recent
  captures.

   Comment by [[matloff][Norman Matloff]] on Twitter about this tweet:

   [[./img/tidyverse.png]]

   The ~data.table~ package, which contains the ~fread()~ function, is
   fantastically fast and overall wonderful. ~fread()~ is featured in
   the introductory data import with R course from DataCamp. You
   should also take a look at the full ~data.table~ course - see this
   [[https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/data-table-cheat-sheet][introductory blog post]] for starters ([[willems][Willems, 2021]]).

** The battle between Python and R has been concluded

   I thought this article with the title from the headline ([[battle][Valdeleon,
   2021]]) is spot on - there's no need to pitch one of these languages
   against the other. Each of them has its pros and cons, and it
   depends on the job which one you should learn and use.

   In fact, many projects require knowledge of both R and Python -
   compare the project featured above where temperature measurements
   are turned into sound ([[wilke][Wilke 2021]]).

* Good-bye (12-17-2021)

  I've just recorded a [[https://youtu.be/IxyqEW9-12s][short good-bye video]]. Here are few parting
  notes for this course.

  #+attr_html: :width 500px
  [[./img/awesome.png]]

** What does it all mean?

   In a recent critique of the proposed California Mathematics
   Framework (CMF), Norman Matloff (known to you as a preeminent
   author of books on stats and R, and of the "TidyverseSceptic"
   essay), writes ([[cmf][Matloff, 2021]]):

   #+begin_quote
   Open-ended data science fits right in to the CMF desire to teach
   kids that "There is no right answer." There is a grain of truth to
   that, but kids must learn how to get the right answer when there is
   one. As one critic rather sarcastically but in my view aptly put
   it, "...if you throw a bunch of data at students, they can group
   it, type it into a spreadsheet, plot graphs and so on. It's pretty
   easy to convince yourself they are doing something called 'Data
   Science'. They don't have to do anything particularly useful with
   the data because there are no right answers."
   #+end_quote

   Contrary to this criticism, the point of our course was that there
   are "right answers", and though we may have to work hard to get
   them, or never succeed, we need to try.

   The purpose of the introductory courses on data science is to give
   you some of the insights and tools to tackle data to get right
   answers and, ideally, solve relevant problems in a scientific
   (i.e. systematic, objective, transparent) way.

   We've only begun to do this in the first course, and we'll continue
   in the "Introduction to Advanced Data Science" (more about that
   later).

   The course also included a close encounter with agile data science
   project management, with the language R, and with the DataCamp
   training platform.

   With *Scrum*, the best known agile method, you've worked with with
   one of the most innovative, fastest growing project management
   methods around. Even with yourself as "project owner", Scrum style
   might help you complete more of your personal projects successfully
   on time.

   With *R*, you've had a taste of one of the best data-focused
   programming languages, well suited for beginners, powerful from the
   first command onwards. There's a lot more music in R, of course,
   and no known limitation. Especially, if you're more in love with
   data than with coding, you've likely made a friend for life!

   The *DataCamp* platform was praised by some in the evaluations - I
   still enjoy working with the platform myself, and I will continue
   to use it in future courses. Programmed tutorials like these can,
   of course, only cover one aspect of learning, and DataCamp does not
   replace spending many hours working independently and on your own.

   Put all three on your resume right now! What're you waiting for?

** What about the class? Choices and changes.

   In the course of the term, you had to endure quite a few changes of
   pace and material - it took me a while to adjust to the level and
   specific knowledge of the participants.

   The good news: you managed - according to your evaluations (thank
   you! Almost 60% responded - not quite as much as I had hoped, but
   good enough), you learnt something and you thought I was up to the
   job!

   There are, of course, a million different ways to design such an
   introductory class. I made a few choices, including:

   1) Base R (stick shift) instead of "TidyVerse" (automatic)
   2) Use of interactive notebooks (literate programming!)
   3) Use GitHub as a code and materials repository
   4) Create lots of (ungraded) tests
   5) Use of DataCamp assignments
   6) Avoid mathematics as much as possible
   7) Reuse tests for the final exam
   8) Let students pick their own projects

   In the next basic data science course (this course will run once a
   year, so this will be Fall 2022), I would stick to all of these
   choices, except perhaps (6). It would be useful to repeat or
   introduce some basic statistics concepts more formally.

   I will also make more use of the Schoology gradebook (though the
   college might switch to another LMS), and offer more graded
   assignments in class.

   I will change the DataCamp assignments and let students complete
   the "Data Science for Everyone" and "Data Visualization for
   Everyone" courses, instead of the more specialized technical
   courses. We can learn R and graphic techniques in class.

   I did enjoy seeing what you came up with for the final projects. At
   the same time (though nobody complained in the evaluation), I think
   I overdid it when I asked you to pick your own topic. Instead, I
   may eliminate projects from this class, and only do projects in the
   followup course when most of the basics are out of the way.

** What next? Follow-up courses.

   Here are a few practical suggestions:

   * Use Scrum (= incremental, prototype-oriented, dialog-rich) in
     your projects at school and outside of school
   * Use R regularly for your computational needs
   * Complete the DataCamp courses that you started in this class
   * Get the mobile DataCamp app and do your (daily) drills

   Most importantly, don't let existing skills go to waste. If you are
   in the followup class, you're okay for another term, but if not,
   you may have to make time yourself to keep your skills fresh.

   The best if not easiest way to do this is to use these skills,
   especially data visualization and rudimentary analysis, in other
   courses. Some examples:

   * When you come across a spreadsheet (CSV format) or another public
     dataset, fire up R, turn it into a data frame (~read.csv()~) and
     analyse and visualize the data using ~plot()~, or some of the
     other simple functions
   * Look at public graphs and evaluate the quality of the
     visualization and the validity of the underlying data
   * When you code yourself, consider using an interactive notebook -
     jupyter notebooks don't just exist for Python and R, but for
     other languages as well.
   * Even if you don't go all the way to "interactive", keep the
     lessons of literate programming in mind and make your code
     readable.

   All data science courses at Lyon are relevant extensions of this
   course, in particular the advanced intro and databases (SQL) in
   the [[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/org/blob/master/spring22.md#org2e649ce][spring 2022]] term.

   In the fall 2022, I'll teach "Data Visualization" (DSC 302). This
   course will go beyond R and include some other popular frameworks
   like D3 or Processing (with JavaScript), perhaps even some Python.

   In the spring 2023, data science will enter the "Digital
   Humanities" (CSC 105) class. In "Machine Learning" (DSC 305), I
   will focus on predictive algorithms - we'll touch upon them already
   in DSC 205.

   So far, so good, so long!

** Final words.

   Thank you from the bottom of my heart for welcoming me to Lyon by
   working with me during this last term. I wish you a Merry
   Christmas, a restful break, and I'm looking forward to seeing some
   of you again next term!

* References

  Really? References in a diary? I know that you know that I am not
  enjoying referencing: it's tedious, it slows me down, it's
  error-prone etc. But it must be done. If you're not convinced, don't
  get a university education, or better, don't work with information
  at all, because referencing is about (a) intellectual property
  rights (you should care about rights!), and (b) the truth (which
  must be spoken!).

* Footnotes

[fn:3]Code updated on December 18, 2021. Interestingly, in this time
the dataset format of the Google CSV file had changed, which broke the
original code (from July).

[fn:2]How will I know? Because it is clear from the discussion and the
students' response if I presented a figure or an argument that
resonates with them or not. Negative example: my insistence on base R
vs. Tidyverse, or on Open Source vs. commercial software, which I feel
strongly about - but I haven't been able to transfer my sentiments to
students. So perhaps these conflicts have less power than I thought.
