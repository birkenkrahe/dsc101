# Followup 1st Sprint Review Sept 9

## Presentations in general

Good start on the sprint reviews last week. It'll take me a few
days to comment on individual projects in the [discussion forum](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/discussions/3).

We have only barely begun learning data science tools, at least in
so far as R is concerned. Web scraping for example, does not take
a lot of lines and efforts, but you need some foundation. I've
nevertheless put some pointers together below.

It's worth spending more time shaping the research question and
doing a proper literature review. The second sprint review is a
month from now, on October 7 ([see schedule](https://github.com/birkenkrahe/dsc101/blob/main/schedule.org)).


## Sprint review presentations


### Viktor/Harry - IMDB vs Rottentomatoes film reviews


### Payne - Exploring Pokemon data


### William - Where does the DoD money go?


## Web scraping (preview)

I have indicated the approximate difficulty level of the tutorials
for beginners. The DataCamp course is the best tutorial but it
requires having completed (most of) the DataCamp courses
"Intermediate R" and "Introduction to the Tidyverse". The
R-Bloggers Tutorial is the most complete one (different
approaches). If you check it out, let me know how you're getting
on!
